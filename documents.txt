 APLOT Auditory Display Function
 APLOT(X, Y, DUR [SEC], UNITS, INTERVAL, F0, TP)
 
 The X-axis is represented by the spatial location of the output 
 signal in left-right space, and the Y-axis is represented by 
 pitch, either as discrete tones or as a continuous tone that 
 changes smoothly. If no output variables are specified, APLOT 
 plays its output through the speakers attached to the workstation 
 via SOUND. For example, APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI)) results in three 
 periods	 of a sine wave being represented. If an input value 
 corresponds to a frequency that is too high or low for APLOT to 
 represent, an off-scale indicator is heard. High- and low-pass 
 filtered noise indicate input values that are too large or too 
 small respectively. All values can be represented by properly 
 adjusting UNITS and/or INTERVAL (see below). Whenever the input 
 values crosses zero (an X-intercept) a brief noise burst is heard. 
 This serves as an anchor so that the user knows when the display 
 has changed sign. 
 
 APLOT(Y)
 If Y is a row vector the values of Y are plotted as Y values and 
 bin indices are interpreted as X values. If Y is an N-by-2 matrix, 
 bins in column 1 are treated as X values and bins in column 2 are 
 treated as corresponding Y values. If Y is a row vector of complex 
 values, the real parts are treated as X values and the imaginary 
 parts are treated as corresponding Y values. In the latter two 
 cases, a sepparate X argument is not permitted.
 
 APLOT(X, Y)
 If X and Y are row vectors of the same length  then each bin of 
 vector X is interpreted as an X value for the corresponding bin in 
 vector Y. If a sepparate Y argument is specified, then X must be a 
 row vector. If X and Y are both specified then any imaginary 
 componants are discarded.
 
 APLOT(X, y, DUR)
 DUR specifies how long the display should last IN SECONDS. Thus, 
 APLOT(Y, 8) will play a representation of the data in vector Y, as 
 a function of index, that lasts for approximately 8 seconds. If 
 DUR is omitted, (e.g. APLOT(Y)), DUR defaults to a value of 5 
 seconds. 
 
 APLOT(X, y, DUR, UNITS)
  UNITS allows the Y-axis (pitch) to be scaled to the desired 
 number of units per interval. THIS is analogous to grid lines on 
 graph paper. Thus, if APLOT receives a UNITS value of 0.2, each 
 unit of input data will consist of 5 intervals; if UNITS is set to 
 1, each unit of input corresponds to a single interval step.
 
 EXAMPLE: 
 APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI), 5, 0.5) 
 includes tones at -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1. When input values are 
 between unit tones, a linearly weighted sum of the two adjacent 
 tones is used. If UNITS is set to 0, the display self-scales, such 
 that the input data utilizes the entire display space. When self-
 scaling the minimum and maximum input values are automatically 
 mapped to the minimum  and  maximum output frequencies 
 respectively. Self-scaling is most useful for getting a 
 qualitative sense of the shape of an unfamiliar dataset. 
 
 APLOT(X, Y, DUR, UNITS, INTERVAL)
 INTERVAL determines the distance between consecutive tones in the 
 discrete display by specifying the number of intervals per octave. 
 Thus, as the value of INTERVAL increases, the pitch difference 
 between consecutive tones decreases. For example, an INTERVAL 
 value of 2 corresponds to half-octave steps, a value of 3 
 corresponds to one third octave steps, a value of 4 corresponds to 
 one fourth octave steps, etc. If INTERVAL is omitted, it defaults 
 to a value of 4 (musical types will recognize this as a minor 
 third). If INTERVAL is set to 1 negative number, then the display becomes
 continuous rather than discrete. Instead of individual tones that fade 
 from one to the next, the continuous display uses a single tone that 
 changes smoothly without steps. In this mode, each unit on the display 
 corresponds to intervals of (a/abs(INTERVAL)) of an octave. 
 
 EXAMPLE:
  APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI), 5, 1, -4) produces a continuous 
 representation of a three period sine wave whose amplitude is 1/2 
 octave peak-to-peak. 
 APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI), 5, 0.5, -4)
 Produces the same figure, but the amplitude is reduced to one 
 quarter octave peak-to-peak.
 
 APLOT(X, y, DUR, UNITS, INTERVAL, F0)
 F0 specifies the frequency that corresponds to a value of zero in 
 the input. If omitted, F0 defaults to 500 Hz. 
 
 APLOT(X, y, DUR, UNITS, INTERVAL, F0, TP)
 TP specifies the tick placement for X-axis indicators. You must 
 specify each value at which a tick is to be located. For example, 
 if Y is a row vector, and is therefore plotted with respect to bin 
 number, TP specifies a set of bin numbers at which ticks will be 
 placed. If both X and Y values are specifieds, then values in 
 vector TP specify values of X for which ticks will be heard in the 
 output. If omitted, TP defaults to an inactive state.  
 
 EXAMPLE:
 Z = 0:.01:10;
 APLOT(Z, 5, 1, 4, 500, [100:100:LENGTH(Z)])
 Produces an auditory plot of the linear values in Z with ticks 
 every 100 bins.
 APLOT(COS(Z), SIN(Z), 5, .2, 4, 500, [-1:.5:1])
 Produces a circular plot with ticks at -1, -.5, 0, .5, and 1.
 
  SIG = APLOT(...);
 sets SIG to an N-by-2 matrix containing the output of APLOT that 
 is normally be played by calling APLOT. SIG contains values 
 between -1 and 1 and can be played with SOUND at a sampling rate 
 of 16384 bins/sec. For example, 
 
 SIG = APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI));
 SOUND(SIG, 16384)
 
 Is equivalent to: 
 APLOT((SIN(0:.01:6*PI))
 
 This is useful when APLOT takes a long time to generate a sound 
 that you wish to play repeatedly.
 
 [SIG, X_CROSSINGS, TICKS, LOCATIONS] = APLOT(X, Y, DUR, UNITS, 
 INTERVAL, F0, TP);
 
 This allows X_CROSSINGS and TICKS to be manipulated independently 
 from the display trace itself. When multiple output arguments are 
 specified, SIG is a vector contains only the tones of the display 
 without the noise bursts indicating zero crossings, or the ticks 
 produced when TP is specified. Similarly, X_CROSSINGS is a vector 
 containing only the noise bursts of the X-intercepts, and TICKS is 
 a vector containing only the clicks produced when TP is specified. 
 X_CROSSINGS and TICKS are contain values between -1 and 1, and can 
 be played with SOUND at a sampling rate of 16384 bins/sec. 
 LOCATIONS is an N-by-2 matrix that contains the stereo amplitude 
 envelope used to "move" the display horizontally.  Thus,
 
 [SIG, X_CROSSINGS, TICKS, LOCATIONS] = APLOT(SIN(0:.01,6*PI), 10, 
 .2, 4, -1:.5:1);
 SOUND( ([1;1]*(SIG + X_CROSSINGS + TICKS))' .* LOCATIONS, 16384)
 
 Is equivalent to:
 APLOT(SIN(0:.01:6*PI), 10, .2, 4, -1:.5:1)
 
 See also ATVAL, SOUND.

--------------------
 ATVAL indicate when a curve attains or crosses a specified value.
 ATVAL(X, LENGTHOUT, MARKS, TICKTYPE)
 X is the original input vector passed to APLOT. lengthout is the length of 
 the signal (in bins) that APLOT produced in its representation of X.
 MARKS is the value or vector of values where auditory indicators are
 desired. TICKTYPE can have values of 0, 1, or FILENAME. if (TICKTYPE == 0) 
 then markers are 0.1 second noise bursts. If (TICKTYPE == 1), then 
 markers are 0.1 sec, 1 KHz unramped tones. If (TICKTYPE == FILENAME) then
 ATVAL uses the wav file at the specified location.

--------------------
 BPLOT: Produce tactile image from data or graphics handle.
 
 BPLOT(Y)
 This function will emboss the data in Y on the currently selected 
 Braille embosser. Axes and data limits ar automatically scaled 
 according to the data contained in Y. The size of the output is 
 determined by the settings specified in BRLPREFS. 
 
 If Y is a vector of real values, then the values of each bin are 
 plotted on the Y-axis, versus their bin number on the X-axis. If 
 any element of Y is complex, then the real value of each element 
 is plotted on the X-axis against the imaginary parts on the Y-
 axis. 
 
 If Y is an M-by-2 matrix, then the values of column 1 are treated 
 as X values and the values in column 2 are treated as 
 corresponding Y values. 
 
 If Y is a handle to a graphics object such as a figure, axes, or 
 line, then that object is embossed. Axes and line objects are 
 scaled according to the data limits of the object. 
 
 BPLOT(Y, AXES_LIMS)
 If Y is a vector or matrix, the value of AXES_LIMS controls the 
 scale of the data displayed. AXES_LIMS is of the form:
      [X_MIN X_MAX Y_MIN Y_MAX]
 
 BPLOT(... FIG_LABEL, X_LABEL, Y_LABEL)
 If the strings FIG_LABEL, X_LABEL, and Y_LABEL are specified, 
 then these strings are converted into Braille and added to the 
 plot. If Y is a graphics handle, then use the commands TITLE, 
 XLABEL, and YLABEL instead before executing BPLOT. 
 
 PIX = BPLOT(...)
 If an output variable is specified, then instead of sending the 
 tactile image to the embosser, the pixel image is returned. This 
 is a matrix each of whose elements will be a dot on the resulting 
 tactile image. Elements with values of 1 represent a dot, and 
 zeros represent blank space. This matrix can be embossed with 
 PIX2BRL.

 YLABEL.

--------------------
 brlchars ASCII characters and their Braille dot representations.
 c = brlchars
 The output variable is a cell array the first row of which contains 
 single ASCII characters, and the second of which contains row vectors 
 containing the dot values that are present in the corresponding Braille 
 character.
 
 Example:
 c = brlchars;     %loads the cell array into variable c
 asc_rep = c{1, 45} 
 asc_rep =
      l
 brl_rep = c{2,45}
 brl_rep =
      1 2 3     %the dots in the Braille letter l

--------------------
 FIG2PIX produces a pixel representation of a Matlab figure.
 PIX = FIG2PIX(H)
 This function produces a pixel representation of a Matlab 
 figure whose handle is contained in H. The size of the 
 representation is determined by the Braille page dims specified 
 in BRLPREFS.M. 
 
 The output variable PIX is suitable for passing to PIX2BRL for embossing.
 
 See also: BRLPREFS, IMBRL, PIX2BRL, SKDMENU, TEXT2BRL.

--------------------
 IMBRL: Emboss image.
 
 IMBRL(IMG, THRESHOLD)
 Converts the image in the variable IMG to a Braille 
 representation and embosses it on the default printer. If  IMG is 
 a file name, then the image in the file specified will be 
 embossed. If the image is a truecolor (RGB) image, then it is 
 converted to gray scale using RGB2GRAY before embossing.
 
 The argument THRESHOLD assigns the gray scale cut-off between 
 black and white (dots and no dots). THRESHOLD can take on values 
 from 1 to 99. If THRESHOLD is omitted, IMBRL uses a default value 
 of 50.
 
 Before embossing or returning, IMBRL analizes the resulting 
 tactile representation to see if dot density is too high. If 
 there are more dots than white space the image is inverted before 
 embossing or returning.
 
 A = imbrl(…)
 If an output argument is specified, the tactile representation is 
 not embossed, but is returned as an m-by-n matrix with ones and 
 zeros representing dots and blank space respectively. This matrix 
 can then be passed as an argument to PIX2BRL for embossing.
 
 IMBRL(IMG, THRESHOLD, TITLE, CROP, DIMS)
 TITLE can be specified as a string. It is converted to Braille 
 using text2brl and is centered at the top of the resulting image. 
 
 CROP is a 2x2 matrix specifying the portion of the image to be 
 embossed or converted. It is of the form 
      [FROM%DOWN TO%DOWN;
       FROM%ACRS TO%ACRS]
 
 DIMS is an optional 2-element vector that specifies the size of 
 the output representation. It is of the form [MAX_WIDTH 
 MAX_HEIGHT]Original image proportions are preserved, and the 
 resulting representation is sized to maximize the image 
 dimentions within the specified values of DIMS. If DIMS is 
 unspecified then IMBRL uses values of X_MAX_PIX and Y_MAX_PIX as 
 obtained from BRLPREFS.
 
 Examples:
 
 IMG = imread(‘foo.bmp’);     %read RGB image from disk
 A = IMBRL(IMG)     %represent full image with default threshold 
 and dimentions with no title.
 
 IMBRL(‘foo.bmp’)     %same as above.
 
 IMBRL(‘foo.bmp’, 70, ‘image of foo’, [5 95;5 95], [100 100])
      %emboss the image contained in file foo.bmp using a 
      %threshold of 70% with a proper title. Cut off the 5% of the image 
      %around the edged, and use a maximum pixel dimention of 100 pixels 
      %in both the x and y dimentions.

--------------------
 PIX2BRL emboss a properly prepared pixel image.
 PIX2BRL(PIX, FILENAME)
 This function turns a properly prepared Braille pixel image into a 
 Braille graphics file and sends it to the currently selected printer. 
 The input argument PIX should contain a matrix whose elements are ones 
 and zeros only. Wherever a matrix element is 1, there will be a dot in 
 the resulting tactile image, and wherever there is a zero, there will be 
 no dot. 
 
 The FILENAME argument allows the user to specify the name of the Braille
 graphics file to which the output should be saved. If no FILENAME 
 argument is specified, the Braille graphics file is saved in a file in 
 the current directory called temp.brg.
 
 If your Braille embosser is not your default printer, you should select
 your embosser in the Print Setup dialog before embossing with PIX2BRL.

--------------------
 SKDMENU uimenu function for SKDtools.
 skdmenu
 Running this function when no figure windows are open adds a menu to the 
 default figure window's menu bar that allows easy embossing and 
 sonification of figure window elements such as lines and axes. 
 
 Typing this command when a figure window is open adds the SKD menu to 
 the current figure's menu bar if it is not already present.
 
 See also: APLOT, BPLOT, FIG2PIX, IMBRL, PIX2BRL.

--------------------
 TEXT2BRL Converts ASCII to a pixel representation of Braille.
 PIX = TEXT2BRL(STRING, CHAR_SIZE)
 Produces a cell array containing pixel representations of the ASCII 
 strings contained in the input variable STRING. The number of elements 
 in the output cell array corresponds to the number of rows in the input 
 STRING matrix. 
 
 The CHR_SIZE argument can be set to 'small', or 'large'. If the argument
 is omitted, the default output is 'small'. The 'large' option is useful 
 when working with Braille embossers set to produce high-resolution 
 tactile graphics. The 'large' setting doubles the spacing between dots 
 in Braille characters.
 
 The output variable PIX contains a pixel representation of Braille
 characters suitable for use with images produced with BRLPREP, FIG2PIX, 
 and IMBRL. It is ideal for adding Braille labels to tactile graphics.
 
 Example:
  p = ones(40); p(2:39, 2:39) = zeros(38);
      %make a square border
 brl_label = text2brl(',box #a4');
      %convert ASCII to Braille pixels
 [r, c] = size(brl_label{1});   %how big is the Braille label?
 p( round( (40-r)/2 )+(1:r), round( (40-c)/2 )+(1:c) ) = brl_label{1};
      %add label to center of box
 pix2brl(p)     %emboss the resulting image
